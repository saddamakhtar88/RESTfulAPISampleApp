# RESTful API Sample App
Sample app for how to interact with Restful APIs without a third party framework

This is not being developed as a Swift package because the idea of this sample is to have network layer raw implementation part of your individual project for finer control. Copy the relevant folders/files in your project and customize it (if required) as per your need.

### Approach:
- Type safety
- Protocol oriented
- Dependency Injection
- Unit testing
- Without a third party dependency to have full control over the implementation

I have used [DependecyRegistry](https://github.com/saddamakhtar88/DependencyRegistry) Swift package for managing the dependencies. This is developed by myself. You may use one of your own.

#### Reference: [Medium Blog](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/writing-network-layer-in-swift-protocol-oriented-approach-4fa40ef1f908)

I have tweaked some of the implementation where ever I felt I have a better approach.
